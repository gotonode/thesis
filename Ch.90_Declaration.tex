I, Riku Talvisto, hereby state the following regarding the use of AI when working on my thesis. How I used AI tools and which tools were used.

Most of my AI use has been done via Sider.ai, which is a browser extension sidebar app that allows direct interaction with the current webpage with various LLM tools. Sider.ai provides Sider Fusion, which dynamically selects an appropriate model to be used based on the given query.

Table \ref{tab:declaration} lists all of the AI tools that I have used and all of their use scenarios.

    \hline
    \textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Use cases} \\
    \hline
    Sider Fusion & To automatically choose the best model from the list of used LLM's based on the query. \\
    \hline
    GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama-3 & Finding synonyms for words. Generating LaTeX code for tables and images, which Iâ€™ve manually tweaked later. Brainstorming ideas about my thesis. Finding related keywords. \\
    \hline
    Writefull & Correcting spelling errors on Overleaf when prompted. \\
    \hline
    Keenious & Find relevant research articles based on already found literature and also based on my own work. \\
    \hline

I've trialed multiple tools and compared their outputs to find the best ones for my current purposes, and this is why the list of LLM's is so extensive.
