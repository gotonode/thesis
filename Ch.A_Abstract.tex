This essay explores the evolving landscape of social engineering in the modern age, paying special attention to how technologies utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), such as enhanced spear phishing tactics may have an impact on it. While AI offers novel opportunities for enhancing cybersecurity measures, it simultaneously empowers malicious actors with sophisticated tools for crafting and executing highly targeted and effective social engineering attacks.

% often a technical vulnerability is also used but these are not always needed

%In-depth analysis of the various ways AI is being exploited to augment social engineering tactics, including the creation of highly believable synthetic media such as deepfake images, videos, and real-time voice morphing, the generation of personalized phishing messages through natural language processing, and the automated open source intelligence gathering processes are performed.

%An analysis of some of the ways AI is being exploited to augment social engineering tactics, including phishing, are performed.

In contrast, the essay also explores how countermeasures against regular social engineering attacks are no longer sufficient. By analyzing the dual-faceted impact of AI on social engineering, this essay aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain, with the countermeasures examined being primarily focused on the human element.

Given the rapidly evolving nature of AI and its expanding capabilities, much of the content presented is speculative. These projections are grounded in an analysis of established social engineering attacks and observed trends in AI development.

%This thesis explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and social engineering, examining the emerging threats as well as opportunities for defense in this space.

%The findings reveal that AI-powered attacks are more convincing and successful than traditional attacks, but AI-driven defense mechanisms can improve detection rates, and AI can develop more engaging training material(?).

% The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into social engineering practices presents exceptional threats to privacy and security, necessitating a truly comprehensive re-evaluation, and enhancement, of current cybersecurity measures.

%The study contributtes to our understanding of AI's impact on social engineering and highlights the need for cybersecurity professionals to adapt to these emerging threats.

%While AI can help detect social engineering attacks, it does not mitigate the need for user training and awareness programs, quite the contrary, with AI-powered attacks the need for awareness and vigilance will likely grown even higher.

%Technologies such as deepfake (deep learning, fake) videos and live voice morphing will change the landscape of SE attacks.
