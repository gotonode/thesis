\begin{abstract}

Social engineering, a subdomain of cybersecurity, is the art and science of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or taking actions that may or may not be in their best interests. Traditionally, social engineering relied heavily on manual labor and human intuition, but with the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as ChatGPT and deepfakes, cybercriminals are able to craft highly targeted and effective social engineering campaigns with novel, unexpected twists.

The research question this thesis address is how to protect end-users and organizations from social engineering attacks that are enhanced by generative AI technologies. To that end, this thesis explores the evolving landscape of AI in social engineering, focusing on attacks such as spear phishing aided by chatbots like ChatGPT and impersonation with hyper-realistic deepfake-generated forgeries. In contrast, the thesis also covers countermeasures against these attacks and evaluates their effectiveness based on relevant literature. Actualized incidents are briefly examined where appropriate.

The findings show that AI-powered social engineering attacks are more persuasive and effective than traditional methods, while current defenses are increasingly inadequate. This underscores the urgent need for cybersecurity professionals to revise their strategies and tools, with AI potentially contributing to this effort.
