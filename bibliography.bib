	abstract = {In recent times, a phishing attack has become one of the most prominent attacks faced by internet users, governments, and service-providing organizations. In a phishing attack, the attacker(s) collects the client’s sensitive data (i.e., user account login details, credit/debit card numbers, etc.) by using spoofed emails or fake websites. Phishing websites are common entry points of online social engineering attacks, including numerous frauds on the websites. In such types of attacks, the attacker(s) create website pages by copying the behavior of legitimate websites and sends {URL}(s) to the targeted victims through spam messages, texts, or social networking. To provide a thorough understanding of phishing attack(s), this paper provides a literature review of Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) techniques: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Scenario-based techniques for phishing attack detection. This paper also presents the comparison of different studies detecting the phishing attack for each {AI} technique and examines the qualities and shortcomings of these methodologies. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive set of current challenges of phishing attacks and future research direction in this domain.},

However, the algorithms and discriminating factors used in these techniques are very diverse in existing works. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of various machine learning algorithms to evaluate their performances over multiple datasets. We further investigate the most significant features within multiple datasets and compare the classification performance with the reduced dimensional datasets. The statistical results indicate that random forest and artificial neural network outperform other classification algorithms, achieving over 97\% accuracy using the identified features.},

However, delving deeper into the details of its implementation reveals that organizations’ human capital cyber security knowledge bases are very low. In particular, the lack of social engineering awareness is a concern in the context of human cyber security risks. This study highlights pitfalls and ongoing issues that organizations encounter in the process of developing the human knowledge to protect from social engineering attacks. A detailed literature review is provided to support these arguments with analysis of contemporary approaches. The findings show that despite state-of-the-art cyber security preparations and trained personnel, hackers are still successful in their malicious acts of stealing sensitive information that is crucial to organizations. The factors influencing users’ proficiency in threat detection and mitigation have been identified as business environmental, social, political, constitutional, organizational, economical, and personal. Challenges with respect to both traditional and modern tools have been analyzed to suggest the need for profiling at-risk employees (including new hires) and developing training programs at each level of the hierarchy to ensure that the hackers do not succeed.},

However, there is much we have yet to know regarding what and how lead to the success of social engineering attacks. This paper proposes a conceptual model which provides an integrative and structural perspective to describe how social engineering attacks work. Three core entities (effect mechanism, human vulnerability and attack method) are identified to help the understanding of how social engineering attacks take effect. Then, beyond the familiar scope, we analyze and discuss the effect mechanisms involving 6 aspects (persuasion, social influence, cognition \& attitude \& behavior, trust and deception, language \& thought \& decision, emotion and decision-making) and the human vulnerabilities involving 6 aspects (cognition and knowledge, behavior and habit, emotions and feelings, human nature, personality traits, individual characters), respectively. Finally, 16 social engineering attack scenarios (including 13 attack methods) are presented to illustrate how these mechanisms, vulnerabilities and attack methods are used to explain the success of social engineering attacks. Besides, this paper offers lots of materials for security awareness training and future empirical research, and the model is also helpful to develop a domain ontology of social engineering in cybersecurity.},

Nevertheless, there are many conceptual deficiencies (such as inconsistent conceptual intensions, a vague conceptual boundary, confusing instances, overgeneralization and abuse) of the term making serious negative impacts on the understanding, analysis and defense of social engineering attacks. In this paper, an in-depth literature survey is conducted, the original meaning of social engineering in cybersecurity is traced, the conceptual evolution and technical development are analysed systematically, and the conceptual problems are discussed. Based on above work, this paper attempts to address these conceptual deficiencies by proposing a more compatible and precise definition of social engineering in cybersecurity ({SEiCS}). This definition eliminates the conceptual inconsistencies, covers the mainstream conceptual connotations, clarifies the conceptual boundary, mitigates the overgeneralization and abuse, etc. Five analysis tables (i.e., the comparative analysis of the {SEiCS} definition vs. mainstream conceptual intensions in the conceptual evolution, the comparative analysis of the {SEiCS} definition vs. typical definitions in the literature, the analysis of confusing “social engineering cases”, the analysis of popular social engineering attack scenarios, and the analysis of social-engineering-based attacks) are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed definition.},

The research herein focuses on the human element of cyber security threats, recognizing that hackers exploit the vulnerabilities and lack of awareness of staff. Then using these issues to create security loopholes and engineer cyber-attacks that include the interruption or infection of information systems, transfer of unauthorized funds, and stealing of credentials. The results of this qualitative study highlight that there is a positive relationship between social engineering and user awareness. The findings build upon the researchers' ongoing work, which postulates that as an increase in contextual social engineering knowledge leads to a decrease in being victims of social engineering and is, therefore, one of the most effective mechanisms for managing social engineering.},

However, our participants exhibited riskier behavior when making decisions on unfamiliar messages, suggesting that this is an area for further exploration.

Social engineering attacks occur when victims do not recognize methods, models, and frameworks to prevent them. The current research explains user studies, constructs, evaluation, concepts, frameworks, models, and methods to prevent social engineering attacks. Unfortunately, there is no specific previous research on preventing social engineering attacks that effectively and systematically analyze it. Current prevention methods, models, and frameworks of social engineering attacks include health campaigns, human as security sensor frameworks, user-centric frameworks, and user vulnerability models. The human as a security sensor framework needs guidance that will explore cybersecurity as super-recognizers, likely policing act for a secure system. This paper intends to critically and rigorously review prior literature on the prevention methods, models, and frameworks of social engineering attacks. We conducted a systematic literature review based on Bryman \& Bell’s literature review method. We found a new approach in addition to methods, frameworks, models and evaluations to prevent social engineering attacks based on our review, which is using a protocol. We found the protocol to effectively prevent social engineering attacks, such as health campaigns, the vulnerability of social engineering victims, and co-utile protocol, which can manage information sharing on a social network. We present this systematic literature review to recommend ways to prevent social engineering attacks.},

This space encompasses questions on attack conditions, employed experimental methods, and interactions with underlying cognitive aspects. As a consequence, much potential in the breadth of existing empirical {SE} research and in its mapping to the actual cognitive processes it aims to measure is left untapped. In this work, we carry out a systematic review of 169 articles investigating overall 735 hypotheses in the field of empirical {SE} research, focusing on experimental characteristics and core cognitive features from both attacker and target perspectives. Our study reveals that experiments only partially reproduce real attacks and that the exploitable {SE} attack surface appears much larger than the coverage provided by the current body of research. Factors such as targets’ context and cognitive processes are often ignored or not explicitly considered in experimental designs. Similarly, the effects of different pretexts and varied targetization levels are overall marginally investigated.

Many social networking sites have millions of registered users who use these sites to share photographs, contact long-lost friends, establish new business contacts and to keep in touch. In this paper, we investigate how easy it would be for a potential attacker to launch automated crawling and identity theft attacks against a number of popular social networking sites in order to gain access to a large volume of personal user information. The first attack we present is the automated identity theft of existing user profiles and sending of friend requests to the contacts of the cloned victim. The hope, from the attacker's point of view, is that the contacted users simply trust and accept the friend request. By establishing a friendship relationship with the contacts of a victim, the attacker is able to access the sensitive personal information provided by them. In the second, more advanced attack we present, we show that it is effective and feasible to launch an automated, cross-site profile cloning attack. In this attack, we are able to automatically create a forged profile in a network where the victim is not registered yet and contact the victim's friends who are registered on both networks. Our experimental results with real users show that the automated attacks we present are effective and feasible in practice.},

We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100\% of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading {URLs} to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01\% of them a modest annual pain.},

	abstract = {Social engineering (as used by the military or law-enforcement) is the emerging technique for obtaining classified information by interacting and deceiving people who can access that information. Rather than using traditional techniques of attacking the technical shields such as firewalls, many sophisticated computer hackers find that social engineering is more effective and difficult to detect by humans. Why can people not effectively detect social engineering, or more specifically, the art of deception? What can be done to augment human abilities for the task? The current findings warrant several possibilities that influence human ability to detect deception. Factors include such things as truth-bias, stereotypical thinking and processing ability. Knowing that human detection ability is limited, we propose a method to automatically detect deception that potentially assists humans. Results show that a system, using discriminant analysis to classify deception performed significantty better than humans in detecting deception. The findings can also be applied to general situations to ensure information authentication scenarios other than social engineering.},

	abstract = {The broad objective of this study is to evaluate the vulnerabilities of an organization’s information technology infrastructure, which include hardware and software systems, transmission media, local area networks, wide area networks, enterprise networks, intranets, and its use of the internet to cyber intrusions. To achieve this objective, the paper attempts to explain the importance and the role of social engineering in network intrusions and cyber-theft. It also discusses in vivid detail, the reasons for the rapid expansion of cybercrime. The paper also includes a complete description and definition of social engineering, the role it plays in network intrusion and cyber identity theft, a discussion of the reasons for the rise in cybercrime and their impact on organizations. In closing the authors recommend some preventive measures and possible solutions to the threats and vulnerabilities of social engineering. The paper concludes that while technology has a role to play in reducing the impact of social engineering attacks, the vulnerability resides with human behaviour, human impulses and psychological predispositions. While literature supports the dangers of psychological susceptibilities in social engineering attacks investment in organizational education campaigns offer optimism that social engineering attacks can be reduced.},

	abstract = {We investigate the anecdotal belief that end users will pick up and plug in {USB} flash drives they find by completing a controlled experiment in which we drop 297 flash drives on a large university campus. We find that the attack is effective with an estimated success rate of 45 – 98\% and expeditious with the first drive connected in less than six minutes. We analyze the types of drives users connected and survey those users to understand their motivation and security profile. We find that a drive's appearance does not increase attack success. Instead, users connect the drive with the altruistic intention of finding the owner. These individuals are not technically incompetent, but are rather typical community members who appear to take more recreational risks then their peers. We conclude with lessons learned and discussion on how social engineering attacks – while less technical – continue to be an effective attack vector that our community has yet to successfully address.},

%% Olennaisia opittavia asioita viittaustekniikoissa ovat viitteen paikka tekstissä, oikea lähdeluettelojärjestys valitun viitetyylin parina sekä taito ja tahto noudattaa annettua tyylimääräystä.
Väitöskirjoissa ja lehti- tai konferenssiartikkeleissa tekstin hyväksyminen riippuu myös
näiden yksityiskohtien asianmukaisesta käsittelystä. Tästä syystä laitoksella nähdään
tarpeelliseksi opiskelijoiden tutustua edes pinnallisesti myös muihin tyylilajeihin ja oppia
käyttämään automatisoituja muotoilutyökaluja tehokkaasti, jolloin tyylimuutokset ovat
tehokkaita.
Lähdeviitteet sijoitetaan aina virkkeen sisäpuolelle. Siten esimerkiksi tekstikappaleen lopussa irrallaan oleva viite ei ole asiallinen. Tilanne ei muutu, vaikka viite sujautettaisiin
tekstikappaleen viimeisen virkkeen sisään. Lähdeviittauksen yhteyteen merkitään mukaan
tarkentavat sivunumerot, mikäli lukijan olisi työlästä löytää asianomainen kohta viitatusta
lähteestä.
Tehokkaita viitteensijoittelupaikkoja ovat esimerkiksi uuden käsitteen nimeämiskohta ja
virkkeen loppu kun kyseessä on lähteestä lainattu väite. On myös muistettava lainausmerkkien käyttö silloin kun tehdään suoria lainauksia.
Tekstin jäsentelyn on tuotava selkeästi esiin, mihin asiaan viite liittyy. Samalla tulee ymmärrettäväksi se, kuinka pitkään tekstikatkelmaan ko. viite liitetään. Ei ole siten asiallista
aloittaa lukua nimeämällä yhtä tai useampaa lähdettä luvun taustaksi, vaan viitteitä on
kiinnitettävä täsmällisemmin väitteisiin ja käsitteisiin. Luvun avaus viitetiedolla voi olla
oire myös suuremmasta ongelmasta: lähderiippuvuudesta. Aloitteleva kirjoittaja helposti
toistaa lähteestä oppimaansa ilman että tarpeellinen analysointi ja prosessointi suhteessa
muuhun opittuun olisi vielä tapahtut.
Viitteillä ja sanamuodolilla on myös tuotava selkeästi esiin se, mikä teksissä on lainattua
ja mikä oman pohdinnan ja valikoinnin tulosta.
Lähdeviittauksiin käytetään Tietojenkäsittelytieteen osastolla numeroitua tyyliä ja APA-tyyliä, valinnan näiden välillä tekevät kunkin ryhmän valvoja ja ohjaaja yhdessä. Numeroitu tyyli on esimerkiksi IEEE- ja ACM-julkaisuissa yleisesti käytetty ja puolustaa
siten paikkaansa. APA-tyyli on poikkeuksellinen ns. kovissa tieteissä, mutta monet valvojista pitävät siitä sen luettavuuden vuoksi. Numeroita joutuu nimiä useammin tarkistamaan lähdeluettelosta, sillä tarkastus- ja arvointiprosessiin kuuluu arvioida myös lähteiden
valitaa ja niiden käyttötapaa.
