\chapter*{Utilization of AI Technologies\label{appendix:declaration}}

I hereby state all of the use cases where I have utilized advanced AI technologies during the research and writing processes of this thesis.

During the research and writing of this thesis the use of AI when working on my thesis. How I used AI tools and which tools were used.

Most of my AI use has been done via Sider.ai, which is a browser extension sidebar app that allows direct interaction with the current webpage, or any specific parts of it, with various LLM tools. Sider.ai provides Sider Fusion, which dynamically selects an appropriate model to be used based on the given query.

Table \ref{tab:declaration} lists all of the AI tools that I have used and all of their use scenarios.

    \textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Use cases} \\

    Sider Fusion & Automatically choosing the best model from the list of used LLM's based on the query. \\
    \hline
    GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama-3 & Finding synonyms for words. Generating LaTeX code for tables and images, which Iâ€™ve manually tweaked later. Brainstorming ideas about my thesis. Finding related keywords. Highlighting my abstract text and asking how many words it contains.\\
    \hline
    Writefull& Correcting spelling errors on Overleaf when prompted. \\
    \hline
    Keenious & Finding relevant research articles based on released literature and also my own, unfinished work. \\
    \hline

\end{table}

I've trialed multiple tools and compared their outputs to find the best ones for my current purposes, and this is why the list of LLM's is so extensive.
