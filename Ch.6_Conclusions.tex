The attack vectors and countermeasures against them in social engineering (SE) have undergone a significant transformation with the advent of modern artificial intelligence (AI). This essay explored the dual-faceted nature of AI on SE, exploring both the enhanced capabilities it provides malicious actors and the countermeasures it provides to cybersecurity professionals, paying special attention to the human element of social engineering.

AI has truly revolutionized the execution of a number of different social engineering attacks, allowing attackers to deploy highly sophisticated and targeted tactics, such as spear phishing and voice phishing (vishing) with real-time voice morphing. Because of this, traditional countermeasures are becoming ever more ineffective.

One of the most notable contributions of AI is its ability to automate and heighten deceptive practices. Machine learning facilitates the crafting of personalized phishing messages that closely mimic legitimate communications, while deepfake technologies alter or produce synthetic media that convincingly impersonate authentic images, audio and videos. Such advancements may enable attackers to deceive targets more efficiently into disclosing sensitive information or taking actions that compromise security.

%AI has empowered attackers to execute highly sophisticated and targeted social engineering attacks, such as spear phishing, vishing (voice phishing) with real-time voice morphing, with truly alarming precision. Sometimes, attacks are augmented with deepfake-generated content. These AI-powered attacks exploit human vulnerabilities more efficiently than ever before, making traditional detection and prevention methods increasingly inadequate.

%%AI's role in augmenting social engineering attacks is most evident in its ability to automate and amplify deceptive practices. Techniques utilizing machine learning allow for the generation of personalized phishing messages that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate communications. Deepfake technologies create convincing synthetic media, including images, audio and even videos, which can be used to deceive targets into divulging sensitive information or performing actions on the attacker's request.

%AI's role in augmenting social engineering attacks is most evident in its ability to automate and amplify deceptive practices. Techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) allow for the generation of personalized phishing messages that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate communications. Deepfake technologies create convincing synthetic media, including images, videos and real-time voice morphing, which can be used to deceive targets into divulging sensitive information or performing actions on the attacker's request.

%Automated open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering further enchances the attacker's ability to craft belieavable pretexts and scenarios, making their social engineering effors more convincing and harder to detect.

Where previously an employee could authenticate a caller by recognizing their voice, intonations, and accents \citep{mitnickArtDeceptionControlling2003}, today and especially in the near future this will not be enough. User training and awareness programs need to be updated for novel threat of AI in SE.

%As we've seen, SE is still as much a threat as it has ever been, despite major efforts to the contrary.

What seems certain is that we can count on the rapid development of AI technologies, AI-based social engineering attacks evolving with them, and the need for continuous, innovative user training growing in the future. Attackers and defenders are playing a never-ending game of "cat \& mouse" where nobody can rest.

%X in Y references that training users effects will wear off in 3 weeks, necessiting continous retraining approaches.

%I'll end with the question that I started with; what, if anything, can the end-user trust anymore? And perhaps, with the advances in AI technology, the answer is "no-one".


%Modern AI can assist with the deployment of the pretext by being a sparring partner to the attacker, giving a safe "sandbox" to try out potential attacks and find ways in which the target might react.
