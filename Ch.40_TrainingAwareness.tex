\section{Company Policy}

Regarding bating attacks, company policy should enforce antivirus scanning of attached media, such as USB thumbdrives, before they can be accessed. Personnel should be instructed to never pick up and plug in found media \citep{salahdine_social_2019}. However, if media is found that is suspected of being used as part of a baiting attack, the employee could notify the front desk or the IT services that such a media device was found within the premises, rather than just ignoring it
