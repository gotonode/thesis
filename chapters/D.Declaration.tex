I hereby state all of the use cases where I have utilized advanced AI technologies during the research and writing processes of this thesis in Table \ref{table:declaration}.

\textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Use cases} \\ \hline  
Sider Fusion & Automatically choosing the most suitable large language model based on my query\\ \hline  
Large language models* & Finding synonyms for words, generating LaTeX code for tables/images, asking for help with other LaTeX commands, brainstorming what the general topic for my thesis could be (before I started my writing process), and performing OCR-to-text from handwritten notes\\ \hline  
Writefull \& Grammarly & Correcting simple spelling errors on Overleaf when prompted via a red underline\\ \hline  
Keenious & Finding relevant research articles based on existing literature and drafts of this thesis\\ \hline

Iâ€™ve trialed multiple generative AI tools and compared their outputs to find the best ones for my current
purposes, which is why the list of LLMs is so extensive.

*Large language models used: GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (4o \& mini), Claude 3.5 Haiku \& Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash \& Pro, Llama-3, DeepSeek R1 70B
