This chapter gives an overview of what social engineering constitutes, provides brief historical context and describes some key terminology that is necessary for further analysis, including about AI. After this, Chapter \ref{chapter:attacks}  examines AI-powered attack methods and tools.

The term \textit{social engineering} dates back to 1842, when it was used to describe centralized planning in an attempt to manage the future development and behavior of a society \citep{hatfieldSocialEngineeringCybersecurity2018a}. Since then, its use has shifted to the field of cybersecurity through the phone phreaking phase (late 1950s to early 1970s) and through to the contemporary hacker culture \citep{wangDefiningSocialEngineering2020}.

As one of the earliest hackers and social engineers, the phreakers, used impersonation to call the Bell Telephone company in order to gain insider information about the telephone networks in order to carry out further attacks without the need for social manipulation \citep{hatfieldSocialEngineeringCybersecurity2018a}, modern hackers view social engineering not as something to be replaced but a key part of any hacker's toolkit, in fact perhaps the most important one \citep{mitnickArtDeceptionControlling2003}.

Interconnected computers on a network can be represented via a node structure. Business operations, from the perspective of social engineering attacks, can also be represented in this way, with the addition of other attack vectors into the map, such as employees, contractors, entryways, trash dumpsters and any and all other means an attacker could attack an organization. Thus the organization forms a system, with the computers and other network equipment forming only a part of the system, with at least one person always using it. Figure 3 represents such an attacker's view on an organization.

There isn't a strict consensus on the field about what actually constitutes an social engineering attack \citep{hatfieldSocialEngineeringCybersecurity2018a}. For the purposes of this thesis, social engineering is defined as "\textit{a type of attack wherein the attacker(s) exploit human vulnerabilities by means of social interaction to breach cybersecurity, with or without the use of technical means and technical vulnerabilities}" \citep{wangDefiningSocialEngineering2020}.

Some key concepts, such as open-source intelligence and pretexting, are explained next.

\textbf{OSINT}, sometimes written as OS-INT, means open-source intelligence. Like the name implies, it involves gathering of intelligence data from publicly locatable sources, such as from the target company's website, or from the social networking profiles of an individual or from other public records.

Various online tools exist for the purposes of gathering intelligence on an individual or an organization, the most famous of which in 2024 is perhaps Maltego. It offers automated forensic gathering and visualizes the found data, making it easier to identify patterns and connections.

Pretexting involves fabricating a story or a scenario, a \textbf{pretext}, that is plausible but fraudulent, to engage the target  with \citep{contehCybersecurityRisksVulnerabilities2016}. With this story, the attacker hopes to gain the victim's trust by appearing legitimate. This type of attack relies heavily on OSINT, or the gathered open-source intelligence, in assisting with the creation of the story. Pretexting is discussed here and not in the chapter which discusses attack vectors because it is usually the precursor to other attacks and is heavily tied with the concept of OSINT \citep{hadnagySocialEngineering2018}.

Unlike other social engineering attacks that rely on technical methods or overt threats or fabricated time pressures, pretexting uses psychological manipulation, trust and relationship-building, making it a potent tool for attackers. The attacker, often assuming the likeness and character of a legitimate entity such as a trusted colleague, an IT service worker, a government official, or a 3rd party service provider, creates a believable narrative story tailored to the target victim's context \citep{mitnickArtDeceptionControlling2003}.

%The success of pretexting is based on the attacker's ability to gather background OSINT and use it convincingly, making the pretext appear legitimate and aligned with the target victim's expectations or experiences \citep{mitnickArtDeceptionControlling2003}.

\textbf{Artificial intelligence} (AI) refers to the various levels of simulation of human, and sometimes animal, intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans or other animals. AI can be categorized in two ways, narrow AI which is designed for specific tasks such as playing StarCraft, and general AI which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human could do.

\textbf{Generative AI} (GenAI) refers to a subset of AI that focusses on creating content, whether that be text, images, music, or more. Unlike with traditional AI, which generally follows programmed rules to make decisions, GenGenAI learns patterns from data and can generate new outputs based on that training. The most prominent example of GenAI is ChatGPT, a type of narrow AI, released by OpenAI to the public in 2022\footnote{https://openai.com/index/chatgpt (accessed 2024-08-19)}.

ChatGPT, built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, is designed to understand and generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence and when to stop generating that sequence (stop symbol). Its widespread availability has demonstrated the potential of AI tools to assist in numerous tasks, from customer service to creating content and aiding in complex information retrieval and processing.
