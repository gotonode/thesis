This chapter reviews key social engineering attack vectors and tools relevant to the modern threat of generative AI. It first explores the misuse of chatbots like ChatGPT for malicious content generation, followed by an investigation of automated intelligence-gathering processes. The discussion then covers deepfake-generated media that can be used for impersonation, concluding with how attackers could use all of this with spear phishing. After this, Chapter \ref{chapter:countermeasures} goes over the countermeasures against these attacks.

Malicious actors can use generative AI  \textbf{chatbots} such as ChatGPT in their schemes, but due to the manufacturer's set limits, some workarounds may need to be used \citep{guptaFromChatGPTtoThreatGPT2023}. For instance, when asking ChatGPT to provide links to websites that provide pirated content such as movies results in the chatbot denying the request, stating that downloading pirated content is unethical and may also lead to the user's computer being infected with malware.

However, regular users and scholars have found a number of ways to bypass ChatGPT's inherent ethic and behavioral guidelines, such as by using reverse psychology\footnote{https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/420 (accessed 2024-07-15)}. In the above example, instead of directly asking for links to the pirate websites, the user can say that because he doesn't want his computer to be infected by malware, ChatGPT should provide links to sites the user should avoid visiting, thus causing ChatGPT to reveal the content the user originally wanted.

\textbf{Automated intelligence processing} has emerged as a pivotal element in contemporary information dissemination processes and thus also in strategic decision-making. By utilizing sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques, threat actors can efficiently collect, process and analyze vast amounts of data from various source, including social media, news outlets and public databases \citep{bilgeAllYourContactsAreBelongToUs2009}. This process not only streamlines the acquisition of relevant data but also enhances the accuracy and timeliness of insights derived from the data.

These processes and tools can be used with open-source intelligence to gather exploitable data about the victim or the organization, or to analyze data that has been gathered via previous successful social engineering attacks. Even seemingly inconsequential bits of data could prove invaluable to the attacker \citep{mitnickArtDeceptionControlling2003}, and AI can aid in the discovery of these insights \citep{blauthArtificialIntelligenceCrime2022}.

One of the most prominent examples of user's data being used without their conset was the Cambridge Analytica scandal \citep{blauthArtificialIntelligenceCrime2022}. The firm used the harvested data to create detailed voter profiles and targeted political advertisements, aiming to influence voter opinions and behaviors.

Deepfake-generated content

\end{comment}

\textbf{Deepfake}, a portmanteau of "deep learning", a type of machine learning, and "fake", is technology which uses artificial neural networks to create highly convincing fake media, either by altering existing content or creating them from scratch \citep{mirskyTheCreationAndDetectionOfDeepfakes2021}. When existing content is being altered, it's called reenactment or replacement, and when entirely new content is created, it's called synthesis. Deepfake content can be images, audio, and even full-resolution video. These hyper-realistic forgeries can depict a person saying or doing things that didn't actually happen, making it difficult for people and AI systems to discern what is real and what is fake \citep{blauthArtificialIntelligenceCrime2022}.

By utilizing deepfake-generated content, deepfakes, attackers can convincingly impersonate trusted individuals or organizations, enhancing the credibility and even the emotional impact of their deceptive strategies \citep{mirskyTheCreationAndDetectionOfDeepfakes2021}. Complete facial reenactment (pose, gaze, blinking, mouth etc) was achieved with only one minute of training video, suggesting that if a malicious actor wants to reenact an individual, they don't need to gather a lot of video material for this. If video material isn't available, attackers can resort to filming the target person exiting the company's premises.

In 2024, deepfake technology was used in a video conference\footnote{https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/634 (accessed 2024-08-24)} to successfully scam an organization for \$25 million.

Phishing & spear phishing

    - Spear phishing a more targeted form of phishing

As the quintessential social engineering attack, \textbf{phishing} is characterized by malicious attempts to gain sensitive information from unaware users, usually via email and by using spoofed websites that look like their authentic counterparts \citep{basitComprehensiveSurveyAIenabledPhishingAttacks2021}. Phishing has been around since 1996, when cybercriminals began using deceptive emails and websites to steal AOL (America Online) account information from unsuspecting users \citep{wangDefiningSocialEngineering2020}.

%Verizon's 2015 Data Breach Investigation Report presents the results of a study where 150,000 phishing emails were sent, in which within an hour 50 \% of the recipients had opened the email and clicked on the phishing links, with the first user clicking the link in only 82 seconds.

\textbf{Spear phishing}, on the other hand, is a more targeted version of phishing, where attackers customize their deceptive messages to a target individual or organization \citep{basitComprehensiveSurveyAIenabledPhishingAttacks2021, fakhouriAIDrivenSolutionsForSocialEngineeringAttacks2024}. Spear phishing that is targeted at high-profile individuals is called \textbf{whaling}. Unlike generic phishing attempts, spear phishing involves gathering detailed information about the victim, via open-source intelligence or otherwise, such as their name, position, and contacts to craft a convincing and personalized message \citep{salahdineSocialEngineeringAttacks2019}. This tailored approach increases the likelihood of the victim falling for the phishing attempt, but has traditionally been a lot more time and energy consuming.

Phishing messages have traditionally been marked by noticeable spelling and grammatical errors. ChatGPT can effectively translate text from the attacker’s native language to the victim’s, maintaining fidelity and even enhancing the deceptive message, provided that the models' ethical restrictions have been bypassed successfully \citep{guptaFromChatGPTtoThreatGPT2023}.

Chatbots like ChatGPT can also integrate gathered intelligence into spam messages, enhancing their relevance. Additionally, incorporating deepfake content, such as a video of the company’s CEO issuing demands, can further increase the effectiveness of phishing attempts.

By employing AI-powered techniques, attackers can automate the creation of deceptive spam messages, greatly enhancing the scale and precision of their spear phishing attacks.

Phishing that is done using voice is called \textbf{vishing} \citep{salahdineSocialEngineeringAttacks2019}. By utilizing traditional phone systems or VoIP (Voice-over-IP), the attacker calls the victim with a pretext to manipulate them into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that may or may not be in their best interests \citep{hadnagySocialEngineering2018}.



With real-time voice morphing, a type of natural speech synthesis, the attacker can effectively and realistically impersonate someone else \citep{doanBTSEAudioDeepfakeDetectiong2023}. This technology converts the attacker's own voice (as input) to the chosen person's voice (as output) automatically during the call. It's hard for the human auditory system to distinguish between real and fake voice samples, especially through voice calls.

The deepfake model has to be trained before it can be used. This is done using audio, which can be sourced from places like YouTube, a company website, or by calling the person the attacker wants to mimic the voice of and recording the conversation.

Some organizations rely on automatic speaker verification technology, which can be tricked via deepfake content \citep{doanBTSEAudioDeepfakeDetectiong2023}.

Back in 2019, attackers successfully used deepfake-generated voice to impersonate an authentic entity\footnote{https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/200 (accessed 2024-05-13)} for monetary gains exceeding 200,000 €.
